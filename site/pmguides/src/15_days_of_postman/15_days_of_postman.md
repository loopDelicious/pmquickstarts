# 15 Days of Postman - for testers

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

Duration: 2

Improve your skills by tackling a new Postman challenge for 15 days in a row.

<img src="assets/tester.png" alt="15 day challenge badge" width="200"/>

### Assess your Postman experience level

- Take [the Postman skills quiz](https://loopdelicious.github.io/postman-skills/)

### Experience level for this test challenge

- Intermediate

### How it works

1. **Get the daily challenge**: Fork the parent collection for each day to your own public Postman workspace.
1. **Review the instructions**: Read the corresponding collection documentation for instructions on how to complete each challenge. Additional resources are available if you want to dive deeper into any of the topics.
1. **Check your solutions**: When you think you've got it, validate your solution by following the instructions in the `Submit your solution` folder. For each day, you check your own work.
1. **Claim your badge**: For the final challenge, submit your final solution to the Postman team. Successfully completing all the challenges allows you to claim your [15 days of Postman badge](https://badgr.com/public/badges/bG6IYzbkTsKrP3t6C2q0BQ).

### Prerequisites

1. **Sign in to Postman:** Create a Postman account if you don't have one already, and log into [Postman for the web](https://go.postman.co) in your browser. To use Postman in a web browser, download and run the [Postman agent](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) on your local machine to overcome cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) limitations. The agent is not the same as the app. On a Mac, you will see an icon for the Postman agent running in the status menu at the top right of your computer screen. On a Windows machine, the Postman agent icon displays in the system tray at the bottom right of your computer screen.

1. **Create a public workspace**: [Create a new Postman workspace](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-a-public-workspace) with visibility set to `Public` to show your work. Choose a unique name for your workspace to deter others from directly copying your answers.

> aside negative
> If you don't want to use Postman in a web browser with the agent, you can instead download and install the Postman app for Mac, Windows, or Linux.

> aside negative
> If you already belong to a Postman team and the organization does not want you to publish this workspace under their team profile, you can create a separate account so the workspace displays under a personal profile.

### What You’ll Learn

- Basic testing skills like how to write and run API tests in Postman
- Higher-level testing skills like using variables, scripts, and automation
- Advanced testing skills like generating dynamic variables, using libraries and mock servers

### What You’ll Need

- A [Postman](https://postman.com/) Account

### What You’ll Build

- A public Postman workspace with collections, monitors, mock servers, code samples, and more.

### Frequently Asked Questions

- **How long does it take to complete the 15 days of Postman challenge?** Plan to spend 5 to 45 minutes every day to explore the topic and dive deeper into the topics you find interesting. Go at your own pace. There is no penalty for taking longer. **Note**: if a very long period of time elapses from when you fork a challenge to when you submit the final solution, you may need to pull the latest changes to ensure the solution you submit is up to date.
- **Do I need to complete all 15 challenges?** Completing all the challenges is required to claim your **15 days of Postman** badge. You are welcome to dive into any of the topics that you find interesting. However, some challenges build on concepts and samples introduced in earlier challenges. So you will receive less guidance for concepts covered earlier in the series.
- **I am new to code. Is this challenge for me?** The challenges are designed for testers and suitable for novice testers. If you know basic software programming concepts and beginner JavaScript (or some other programming language), this challenge is for you. If you're an API professional, but don't identify as a tester, you may need to do extra research to complete some challenges.
- **Do I need to create a public workspace?**: Yes. The validation requires all of your work to be located in a public workspace. If you belong to your company's Postman team, your company may not want the public workspace to be listed under their public team profile. In this case, use your personal Postman account, or create a separate Postman account, to complete the challenge.
- **I'm stuck. Can someone please help?**
  - Re-read the instructions carefully, and check out the documentation and additional resources listed in the instructions.
  - Try submitting an incomplete solution locally to reveal clues in the test results.
  - Look for similar examples in the [community forum](https://community.postman.com/).
  - If you're asking for help, try posting in the [Training](https://community.postman.com/c/training/38) section of the community forum. Make sure to include a thorough explanation of your question, what you've tried already, and include a direct link to your own public workspace so others can see where you're stuck.
  - If your question is related to the administration of this badge (for example, not a technical Postman question), you can ask for guidance in the [Training](https://community.postman.com/c/training/38) section of the community forum.

2.  **Read the documentation:** In your fork, select the first folder `API client`. Expand the context bar on the right to follow the instructions in the collection documentation. If you find it bothersome to navigate between the documentation while working in a different area of Postman, remember that you can open a new tab to keep your place in the documentation, and then switch between tabs.
3.  **Submit your solution:** Select the second folder `Submit your solution` and follow the instructions in the documentation to validate your solution.

### Check your workspace for completeness

Make sure all of your tests are passing locally, and that you've completed the requirements. This includes all of the collections, mock servers, and scheduled collection runs required to complete the training.

If you need support figuring out how to complete the requirements, ask in the [Postman community forum using the "training" category](https://community.postman.com/c/training).

### Submit your workspace

Fork the parent collection and environment to your own workspace.
