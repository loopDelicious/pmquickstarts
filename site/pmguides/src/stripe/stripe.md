### Prerequisites

- a [Stripe Account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
- a [Postman Account](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup)

### What You’ll Learn

- Authorize the Stripe API using environment variables
- Start making API calls with Postman
- Create a customer using the API
- Pass metadata in a request

### What You’ll Build

- A Postman Collection with authorized API requests

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Fork the collection and environment

Duration: 2

To get started fork the collection from [Stripe's public workspace](https://www.postman.com/stripedev/workspace/stripe-developers/overview) within Postman.

![Fork the collection](assets/postman_fork_collection.png)

Enter a name for your fork and select the workspace where it will be created:

![Fork label](assets/postman_fork_form.png)

You can also [fork the environment template](https://www.postman.com/stripedev/workspace/stripe-developers/environment/665823-fd03c411-50c3-4d60-81fa-1820e820eeb3/fork?origin=tab) from the Stripe Developers Workspace:

![Fork environment](assets/postman_fork_env_template.png)

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Set your API key

Duration: 1

To run requests you'll need to supply your [testmode secret API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) and set it as an [environment variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) within your workspace.

To set any environment variable, create a new environment within Postman:

![Create new environment](assets/postman_create_new_env.png)

Add your secret key as a variable to the environment and save:

![set API key](assets/postman_set_key_and_save.png)

Set the environment to active:

![save as active](assets/postman_set_active_env.png)

Or, select it from the dropdown to set the active environment:

![set environment dropdown](assets/postman_set_collection_environment.png)

If your environment is set up correctly, you should see your secret key value if you mouse over the `secret_key` variable in the Token field:

![mouseover variable resolution](assets/postman_secret_key_mouseover.png)

Be sure to save the collection after you've configured the set the key:

![save changes](assets/postman_save_key.png)

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Make a test call

Duration: 1

You should be ready now to make a test call. An easy first call is to create a customer:

![see customer endpoints](assets/postman_customer_endpoints.png)

Since no parameters are required to create a customer, you can just hit the **Send** button to run this request:

![send button](assets/postman_create_customer_send.png)

If your environment is set up you'll get a customer object back as the response to the call:

![create customer](assets/postman_customer_create_no_params_response.png)

Add parameters to the call by clicking the body tab, where you'll see a list of available parameters. Select and populate the ones you want to use. Here's an example of adding an `email` parameter:

![create customer with email](assets/postman_create_customer_with_email_request.png)

You'll see the email address in the response:

![create customer with email response](assets/postman_create_customer_with_email_response.png)

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Passing Metadata In a Request

Duration: 1

Right now [metadata](https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata) does not show up as a optional parameter on requests, but it can still be provided to calls that will accept it. Here's an example of adding 2 metadata fields to the customer create call:

![set metadata on a request](assets/postman_set_metadata.png)

Metadata key value pairs can be updated in a similar manner. To remove a metadata key during an update call, supply the `metadata[key]` parameter without setting a value. This will pass an empty string as part of the request:

![clear metadata key](assets/postman_update_metadata.png)

To remove all metadata pass the `metadata` parameter without a value set:

![remove metadata key](assets/postman_remove_metadata.png)

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Next Steps

Duration: 1

If you want to learn more about the Stripe API, check out other endpoints in the collection, and review the [official API documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api) for more details.
