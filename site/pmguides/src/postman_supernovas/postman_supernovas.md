- We recommend following the ‚Äú[30 Days of Postman](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/30-days-of-postman-for-developers/overview)‚Äù challenge and completing 15 days of your choosing.
*After being accepted into the program, you must complete the full 30 days and claim the additional badge within your first 30 days.*

- Another option that grants a badge upon completion is the [Introduction to HTTP APIs in Postman](https://quickstarts.postman.com/guide/introduction_to_postman/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) Quickstarts tutorial.
- Postman Supernova, Valentin Despa put together an excellent ‚Äú[Intro to Postman](https://youtu.be/2oOSnxZ28fA)‚Äù video series.

## Public Workspace & Profile
Duration: 2

![Public Workspace & Profile](assets/public_profile_workspace.png)


### Postman Public Workspace
Your Postman public workspace is the home for all of your work.
Here you can share all of your other workspaces, links and important collections to give others in the community a chance to see your work.

**New to public workspaces?**
</br>
[How to Set Up Your First Public Workspace in 5 Easy Steps](https://blog.postman.com/how-to-set-up-public-workspaces/) blog post, [documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-workspaces/).

---

#### When to Create a Public Workspace
Public workspaces are a valuable tool to assist in making polished presentations. You can use a workspace for all of your talks and public work.
</br>

**Examples:**
</br>
\- If you‚Äôre consistently speaking/publishing about mocks, you could have a specific public workspace for everything mocking related.
</br>
\- When you find an API you‚Äôre particularly excited about, make an API, or want a dedicated space for a project, those could be separate public workspaces.
</br>
\- If you have a passion project or something topical.

#### Example Public Workspaces

## Making Your Contribution

### Before Your Contribution

Our definition of what makes a qualifying contribution is flexible. As long as the event or content is public, talks about Postman and/or APIs, has the goals of community building & education, then it counts.

Contributions can be in any language and in any timezones. An event or video does **not** have to be in English or in an American-friendly timezone.
We value our global community and strongly encourage building local communities of your own!

Events are also not required to be exclusively in-person or virtual. Feel free to host any variations including hybrid events to your preferences.

We are here to support you as well. We‚Äôre excited to meet the communities that you‚Äôre involved with, and to support your growth in ours. We are happy to help promote your contribution on the official Postman social media channels as well as provide feedback and ideas for events/content contributions.

To remain in the program, we require regular event participation or content contributions, approximately one event (speaking/hosting) or two content contributions per-quarter.

You‚Äôll have lots of support from the Postman team. Whether you‚Äôre experienced or brand new to public tech events, we‚Äôre here. We are all expanding our networks and opportunities are opening up more frequently than ever.

We understand that things happen and sometimes you are too busy to make your contribution for the quarter. If however you miss two quarters in a row, this can result in your graduation from the program.
